# autosort

![Build](https://img.shields.io/github/workflow/status/viv-codes/autosort/Lint?style=for-the-badge)

A utility that automatically organizes files based on metadata within the linux filesystem. I wrote this primarily to automatically sort photos from my camera, as well as to sort old archival files.
